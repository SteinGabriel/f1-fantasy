## Getting started

- Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed on your machine.
  
### Installation
1. In a terminal, clone this repository and navigate to project directory `cd f1-fantasy`. 
2. To install all necessary packages, simply run the utility file `node yarn-install.js`. This file will look for package.json files recursively and install the dependencies on each folder of the project where a package.json file is present.    
3. After that you should be ready to startup the project running `yarn start-local` at the root level. This command will start both server and client concurrently. Client will be served on port `3000` and server on port `8000`. A new browser tab should be open automatically. 

### TODO
- [ ] Document project structure.
